# Testing Strategy

This document outlines the testing strategy for the MERN stack application, covering unit, integration, and end-to-end testing.

## 1. Unit Testing

Unit tests are focused on testing individual components and functions in isolation.

- **Client-Side (React):**
  - **Tools:** Jest, React Testing Library
  - **Location:** `client/src/tests/unit`
  - **Description:** We test individual React components, utility functions, and custom hooks. Components are rendered in a virtual DOM, and we assert their behavior and output. Mocks are used for dependencies like API calls.

- **Server-Side (Node.js/Express):**
  - **Tools:** Jest
  - **Location:** `server/tests/unit`
  - **Description:** We test utility functions and middleware. For middleware, we mock the `req`, `res`, and `next` objects to verify that the middleware behaves as expected.

## 2. Integration Testing

Integration tests focus on the interaction between different parts of the application.

- **Client-Side (React):**
  - **Tools:** Jest, React Testing Library
  - **Location:** `client/src/tests/integration`
  - **Description:** We test the integration of multiple components, such as forms that interact with state management or components that fetch data from an API. API calls are typically mocked to isolate the client-side integration.

- **Server-Side (API):**
  - **Tools:** Jest, Supertest, MongoDB Memory Server
  - **Location:** `server/tests/integration`
  - **Description:** We test the API endpoints by making HTTP requests to the running server. A separate in-memory database is used to avoid interfering with development data. These tests cover the entire request-response cycle, including database operations.

## 3. End-to-End (E2E) Testing

E2E tests simulate real user scenarios from start to finish.

- **Tools:** Cypress
- **Location:** `cypress/`
- **Description:** We write E2E tests for critical user flows, such as user registration, login, and CRUD operations. Cypress runs the tests in a real browser, interacting with the application just like a user would. This ensures that the entire application works together as expected.

## 4. Running Tests

Test scripts are defined in `package.json`:

- `npm test`: Runs all tests.
- `npm run test:unit`: Runs only unit tests.
- `npm run test:integration`: Runs only integration tests.
- `npm run test:e2e`: Runs only end-to-end tests.
